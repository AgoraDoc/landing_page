The host demonstrates their products in a live interactive streaming channel, and provides a product list with links; the audience can watch the host and place orders for desired products simply by clicking the links. During the interactive streaming, an audience member can become a co-host to interact with the host in real-time. The host can also invite the host of another channel to co-host; the two hosts can then compete in promoting their products, thus stimulating the audience's enthusiasm for buying and enhancing the fun of live interactive streaming.",
